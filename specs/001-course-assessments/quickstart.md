# Quickstart Guide: Course Assessments Documentation

This guide explains how to view the newly planned documentation for course assessments.

## Prerequisites

*   A local Docusaurus development server running.

## Viewing the Assessments Documentation

1.  **Navigate to the documentation page**:
    Once the Docusaurus site is running, navigate to the main documentation section. The `assessments.md` page will be accessible via the main sidebar navigation.

2.  **Accessing the content**:
    The `docs/assessments.md` file is structured to provide:
    *   A summary table detailing each assessment's name, week, weight, and type.
    *   Dedicated sections for each assessment, including detailed instructions and rubrics.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the content for `docs/assessments.md` based on this plan.
*   Update `sidebars.js` to ensure `assessments.md` is visible in the navigation.
