# Specification Quality Checklist: Course Assessments

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-21
**Feature**: specs/001-course-assessments/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The following [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were identified and require user input:
    - Instructions/Rubrics Format
    - Structure of `docs/assessments.md`
    - Specific Requirements for Simulation/CAD
- These will be presented to the user for resolution.
