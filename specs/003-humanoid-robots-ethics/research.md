# Research Findings: Humanoid Robots – Deployments, Ethics, and Policy

**Date**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: Humanoid Robots: Deployments, Ethics, and Policy
**Research Area**: Policy Discussion Scope

## Decision:
Focus on **General Ethical Frameworks** (Option C) for policy discussions.

## Rationale:
While existing regulations and proposed legislation are relevant, the core of the "philosophical closure" mentioned in the `/sp.plan` prompt points towards foundational ethical principles. A broad ethical framework provides a more comprehensive and forward-looking perspective, setting the stage for future policy development without being constrained by current legislative limitations. This approach allows for a more philosophical exploration of AI alignment and societal impact.

## Alternatives Considered:
- **Existing Regulations & Standards (Option A)**: Considered too narrow; current regulations may not adequately address the rapid advancements in humanoid robotics by 2025.
- **Proposed Legislation & Future Frameworks (Option B)**: Also considered, but this can quickly become outdated and may not capture the nuanced ethical debates.

**Research Area**: Economic Impact Detail

## Decision:
Adopt a **High-level Overview** (Option A) for the economic impact analysis.

## Rationale:
A high-level overview presents the core arguments of job displacement versus job creation and economic growth, aligning with the "philosophical closure" aspect of the plan. Providing specific market forecasts or in-depth case studies would require detailed economic modeling beyond the scope of a documentation specification. This approach offers sufficient depth for a forward-looking discussion without getting bogged down in quantitative analysis.

## Alternatives Considered:
- **Key Case Studies (Option B)**: Useful, but could become outdated quickly and may not represent the global impact broadly.
- **Market Forecasts (Option C)**: Highly speculative and complex; difficult to make authoritative statements without dedicated economic research.

**Research Area**: Video Inclusion

## Decision:
Provide **Detailed Descriptions & Links** (Option A).

## Rationale:
Including direct links to prominent videos offers the most value to users, allowing them to see the robots in action. Detailed descriptions will provide context and highlight key functionalities and deployment scenarios, directly supporting the feature's goals. This offers a rich, multi-modal understanding of the robots' capabilities and real-world presence.

## Alternatives Considered:
- **Descriptions Only (Option B)**: Less engaging and harder for users to verify or explore further.
- **Functionality & Context Focus (Option C)**: While valuable, it might miss the impact of seeing the robots operate in their environments, which video provides.
