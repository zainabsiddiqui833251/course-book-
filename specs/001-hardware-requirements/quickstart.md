# Quickstart Guide: Hardware Requirements Documentation

This guide explains how to access and understand the hardware and software requirements documentation for the course.

## Prerequisites

*   Access to the course documentation website.

## Viewing the Hardware Requirements

1.  **Navigate to the documentation**:
    Access the course website. The hardware requirements will be available as a top-level page, typically listed in the main sidebar navigation under a relevant section like "Course Information" or "Getting Started".

2.  **Locate the `hardware-requirements.md` page**:
    The page will be titled "Hardware and System Requirements" or similar.

3.  **Understand the Tiered Structure**:
    The documentation presents requirements in three tiers:
    *   **Simulation Tier**: For software-based simulations.
    *   **Small Robot Tier**: For basic physical robotics projects.
    *   **Full Build Tier**: For advanced projects requiring more comprehensive hardware.

4.  **Review Component Lists and Costs**:
    For each tier, you will find:
    *   A list of recommended hardware components.
    *   A list of required software components.
    *   Estimated cost ranges in both PKR and USD.

## Next Steps

*   Implement the content for `docs/hardware-requirements.md` based on the plan.
*   Update `sidebars.js` to ensure the new page is correctly linked in the navigation.
