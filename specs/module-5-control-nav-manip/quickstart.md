# Quick Start: Module 5 - Control, Navigation & Manipulation

**Date**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: Module 5 - Control, Navigation & Manipulation
**Spec**: specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/plan.md
**Research**: specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/research.md
**Data Model**: specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/data-model.md

## Overview

This module focuses on advanced control techniques, real-time systems, and practical implementation using ROS 2 and MoveIt for robot control, navigation, and manipulation. It aims to provide learners with the skills to develop sophisticated autonomous behaviors.

## Getting Started

To begin working with Module 5, review the following design artifacts:

1.  **Specification (`spec.md`)**: Understand the module's goals, user stories, functional requirements, and success criteria.
    *   `specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/spec.md`
2.  **Implementation Plan (`plan.md`)**: Familiarize yourself with the technical context, constitution check, and project structure.
    *   `specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/plan.md`
3.  **Research Findings (`research.md`)**: Review decisions made regarding ROS 2 distribution, testing frameworks, and performance goals.
    *   `specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/research.md`
4.  **Data Model (`data-model.md`)**: Understand the key entities like Control Systems, Navigation Components, Motion Planning, Robot State, and Environment Models.
    *   `specs/01-module-5-control-nav-manip/data-model.md`

## Core Technologies and Examples

The module heavily emphasizes practical application within the ROS 2 ecosystem, particularly:
*   **ROS 2 Navigation2**: For autonomous navigation, SLAM, and path planning.
*   **MoveIt2**: For motion planning, inverse kinematics, and grasp planning.
*   **Control Theory**: Implementation of PID, LQR, and modern control concepts.
*   **Simulation**: Gazebo/Ignition Gazebo for testing and validation.

## Next Steps

After reviewing the initial documentation:
*   Proceed to Phase 0 (Research) if any `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` remain unresolved in the plan. (Already done, `research.md` generated).
*   Proceed to Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) if further design artifacts are needed. (Data model created, API contracts skipped as not applicable).
*   Proceed to Phase 2 (Task Generation) using `/sp.tasks`.
*   Consult `/sp.clarify` if further clarification on requirements is needed.
