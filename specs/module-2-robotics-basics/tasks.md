# Tasks: Module 2 Robotics Basics & Kinematics Documentation

**Input**: Specification for Module 2 (`specs/module-2-robotics-basics/spec.md`)
**Prerequisites**: Plan for Module 2 structure is complete.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Content Creation (Chapters 1-4)

**Purpose**: Draft the content for each of the 4 chapters in Module 2.

- [ ] T201 Draft content for `docs/module-2-robotics-basics/chapter-1.md` ("Degrees of Freedom and Joint Types") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T202 Draft content for `docs/module-2-robotics-basics/chapter-2.md` ("Forward and Inverse Kinematics") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T203 Draft content for `docs/module-2-robotics-basics/chapter-3.md` ("Dynamics, Torque and Motor Sizing") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T204 Draft content for `docs/module-2-robotics-basics/chapter-4.md` ("Coordinate Frames and Denavit-Hartenberg") (1000–1500 words).

### Phase 2: Enhancements

**Purpose**: Add diagrams, Python code examples, ROS 2 snippets, and practice questions.

- [ ] T205 Add 1–2 relevant diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid) to each chapter (Chapters 1-4).
- [ ] T206 Include Python code examples in relevant chapters.
- [ ] T207 Include ROS 2 snippets in relevant chapters.
- [ ] T208 Add 4–6 practice questions at the end of each chapter (Chapters 1-4).

### Phase 3: Review and Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure content quality, accuracy, and adherence to standards.

- [ ] T210 Review all chapters for clarity, accuracy, and adherence to word count.
- [ ] T211 Verify all diagrams render correctly.
- [ ] T212 Test code examples (Python, ROS 2) for functionality and correctness.
- [ ] T213 Review practice questions for relevance and clarity.
- [ ] T214 Ensure compliance with project constitution regarding content structure.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Phase 1**: Must be completed before Phase 2.
-   **Phase 2**: Must be completed before Phase 3.

### Within Each Chapter

-   Content creation (Phase 1) must precede enhancements (Phase 2).

### Parallel Opportunities

-   **Phase 1**: Tasks T201-T204 (chapter content creation) can be worked on in parallel.
-   **Phase 2**: Tasks T205-T208 can be partially parallelized.
-   **Phase 3**: Review tasks can be parallelized to some extent.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Module 2 Chapters)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Content Creation for all chapters.
2.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review initial chapter content for Module 2.
3.  Proceed with Phase 2: Enhancements.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Phase 1.
2.  Complete Phase 2.
3.  Complete Phase 3.

## Notes

-   The word count range (1000–1500 words) is a guideline.
-   Specific locations for code examples and ROS 2 snippets should be determined contextually.
