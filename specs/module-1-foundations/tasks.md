# Tasks: Module 1 Foundations Documentation

**Input**: Plan and Specification for Module 1 Documentation
**Prerequisites**: Plan for Module 1 structure is complete.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Content Creation (Chapters 1-5)

**Purpose**: Draft the content for each of the 5 chapters in Module 1.

- [ ] T101 Draft content for `docs/module-1-foundations/chapter-1.md` (900-1400 words).
- [ ] T102 Draft content for `docs/module-1-foundations/chapter-2.md` (900-1400 words).
- [ ] T103 Draft content for `docs/module-1-foundations/chapter-3.md` (900-1400 words).
- [ ] T104 Draft content for `docs/module-1-foundations/chapter-4.md` (900-1400 words).
- [ ] T105 Draft content for `docs/module-1-foundations/chapter-5.md` (900-1400 words).

### Phase 2: Enhancements

**Purpose**: Add diagrams, code examples, and questions.

- [ ] T106 Add 1-2 Mermaid diagrams to each chapter (Chapters 1-5).
- [ ] T107 Include Python code examples in relevant chapters.
- [ ] T108 Include ROS 2 snippets in relevant chapters.
- [ ] T109 Add 4-6 practice questions at the end of each chapter (Chapters 1-5).

### Phase 3: Review and Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure content quality, accuracy, and adherence to standards.

- [ ] T110 Review all chapters for clarity, accuracy, and adherence to word count.
- [ ] T111 Verify all diagrams render correctly.
- [ ] T112 Test code examples for functionality and correctness.
- [ ] T113 Review practice questions for relevance and clarity.
- [ ] T114 Ensure compliance with project constitution (e.g., Markdown format, Docusaurus structure).

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1**: Must be completed before Phase 2.
- **Phase 2**: Must be completed before Phase 3.

### Within Each Chapter

- Content creation (Phase 1) must precede enhancements (Phase 2).

### Parallel Opportunities

- All chapter content creation (T101-T105) can be worked on in parallel.
- Enhancements (T106-T109) can be partially parallelized, but ideally done after core content is stable.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Module 1 Chapters)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Content Creation for all chapters.
2.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review initial chapter content.
3.  Proceed with Phase 2: Enhancements.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Phase 1.
2.  Complete Phase 2.
3.  Complete Phase 3.

## Notes

- The word count range (1000-1500 words) is a guideline and should be adhered to where practical.
- Specific locations for code examples and ROS 2 snippets should be contextually determined during content creation.
