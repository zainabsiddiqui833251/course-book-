# Tasks: Module 3 AI Integration & Embodied Learning Documentation

**Input**: Specification for Module 3 (`specs/module-3-ai-integration/spec.md`)
**Prerequisites**: Plan for Module 3 structure is complete.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Content Creation (Chapters 1-5)

**Purpose**: Draft the content for each of the 5 chapters in Module 3, adhering to word count and including technical details.

- [ ] T301 Draft content for `docs/module-3-ai-integration/chapter-1.md` ("Reinforcement Learning in Physical Worlds") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T302 Draft content for `docs/module-3-ai-integration/chapter-2.md` ("Sim-to-Real Transfer and Domain Randomization") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T303 Draft content for `docs/module-3-ai-integration/chapter-3.md` ("Imitation Learning and Learning from Demonstrations") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T304 Draft content for `docs/module-3-ai-integration/chapter-4.md` ("Large Language Models as Robot Brains (2025 methods)") (1000–1500 words).
- [ ] T305 Draft content for `docs/module-3-ai-integration/chapter-5.md` ("Training in Isaac Gym and MuJoCo") (1000–1500 words).

### Phase 2: Enhancements

**Purpose**: Add diagrams, Python code examples, ROS 2 snippets, and practice questions to each chapter.

- [ ] T306 Add 1–2 relevant diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid) to each chapter (Chapters 1-5), illustrating key concepts like RL loops, sim-to-real transfer, LLM architectures, etc.
- [ ] T307 Integrate runnable Python code examples (using `ikpy`, `numpy`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch`, `gymnasium`, etc.) within relevant chapters.
- [ ] T308 Include ROS 2 snippets demonstrating integration concepts (e.g., simulation interfaces, command transmission) in relevant chapters.
- [ ] T309 Add 4–6 practice questions at the end of each chapter (Chapters 1-5) to test understanding.

### Phase 3: Review and Validation

**Purpose**: Ensure content quality, accuracy, and adherence to standards.

- [ ] T310 Review all chapters for clarity, accuracy, adherence to word count, and integration of all required elements (diagrams, code, questions).
- [ ] T311 Verify all diagrams render correctly.
- [ ] T312 Test code examples (Python) and ROS 2 snippets for functionality.
- [ ] T313 Review practice questions for relevance and clarity.
- [ ] T314 Ensure compliance with project constitution regarding content structure and quality.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

-   **Phase 1**: Must be completed before Phase 2.
-   **Phase 2**: Must be completed before Phase 3.

### Within Each Chapter

-   Content creation (Phase 1) must precede enhancements (Phase 2).

### Parallel Opportunities

-   **Phase 1**: Tasks T301-T305 (chapter content creation) can be worked on in parallel.
-   **Phase 2**: Tasks T306-T309 can be partially parallelized.
-   **Phase 3**: Review tasks can be parallelized to some extent.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (Module 3 Chapters)

1.  Complete Phase 1: Content Creation for all chapters.
2.  **STOP and VALIDATE**: Review initial chapter content for Module 3.
3.  Proceed with Phase 2: Enhancements.

### Incremental Delivery

1.  Complete Phase 1.
2.  Complete Phase 2.
3.  Complete Phase 3.

## Notes

-   The word count range (1000–1500 words) is a guideline.
-   Specific libraries for Python code examples (e.g., `ikpy`, `numpy`, ML frameworks) and ROS 2 snippets should be determined contextually per chapter.
