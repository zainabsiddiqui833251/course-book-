# Quick Start: Humanoid Design Module (Module 4)

**Date**: 2025-12-22
**Feature**: Humanoid Design Module (Module 4)
**Spec**: specs/module-4-humanoid-design/spec.md
**Plan**: specs/module-4-humanoid-design/plan.md
**Research**: specs/module-4-humanoid-design/research.md
**Data Model**: specs/module-4-humanoid-design/data-model.md

## Overview

This module provides a hardware-focused introduction to designing humanoid robots. It covers essential topics including human biomechanics, locomotion, manipulation, materials, actuators, and power systems, emphasizing real-world buildable designs.

## Getting Started

This module is designed to be accessed through its specification and research documents. To begin your journey into humanoid robot design:

1.  **Review the Specification**: Understand the module's scope, requirements, and success criteria by reading the main specification file:
    *   `specs/module-4-humanoid-design/spec.md`

2.  **Explore the Research Findings**: Delve into the findings that informed the module's design decisions, especially regarding hardware choices and testing methodologies:
    *   `specs/module-4-humanoid-design/research.md`

3.  **Understand the Data Model**: Familiarize yourself with the key entities and data structures relevant to humanoid robot design:
    *   `specs/module-4-humanoid-design/data-model.md`

4.  **Consult the Implementation Plan**: For an overview of the development considerations and technical context:
    *   `specs/module-4-humanoid-design/plan.md`

## Next Steps

After reviewing the initial documentation, you can proceed to:

*   **Clarify Requirements**: If any aspects of the specification need further detail, use the `/sp.clarify` command.
*   **Build Technical Plan**: If you are ready to architect the implementation, use the `/sp.plan` command (though this is a follow-up to an existing plan).
*   **Create Tasks**: Once the plan is refined, use `/sp.tasks` to break down the work into actionable items.
