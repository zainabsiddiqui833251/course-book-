# Feature Specification: Humanoid Design Module (Module 4)

**Feature Branch**: `module-4-humanoid-design`
**Created**: 2025-12-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: Module description covering humanoid robot design principles.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Understand Human Biomechanics for Robotics (Priority: P1)
As a student, I want to understand the principles of "Human Biomechanics and Anthropometric Data" so that I can design robot components that interface with humans.
**Why this priority**: Foundational knowledge for the module.
**Independent Test**: Verify content covers key biomechanical concepts and anthropometric data relevant to robotics.
**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am a student learning about humanoid design, **When** I access the content on "Human Biomechanics and Anthropometric Data", **Then** I can identify key body measurements and their relevance to robot design.

### User Story 2 - Learn Legged Locomotion and Bipedal Balance (Priority: P1)
As a student, I want to learn about "Legged Locomotion and Bipedal Balance" so that I can design robots capable of stable movement.
**Why this priority**: Core aspect of humanoid robotics.
**Independent Test**: Verify content covers principles of walking, balance, and stability for legged robots.
**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am studying humanoid robot locomotion, **When** I review the "Legged Locomotion and Bipedal Balance" chapter, **Then** I can explain common strategies for maintaining balance in bipedal robots.

### User Story 3 - Design for Arm, Hand, and Dexterous Manipulation (Priority: P1)
As a student, I want to understand "Arm, Hand and Dexterous Manipulation Design" so that I can design robotic manipulators capable of interacting with objects.
**Why this priority**: Essential for robot interaction.
**Independent Test**: Verify content covers degrees of freedom, grip mechanisms, and manipulation strategies.
**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am designing a robotic hand, **When** I study the "Arm, Hand and Dexterous Manipulation Design" chapter, **Then** I can identify different types of grippers and their applications.

### User Story 4 - Select Materials, Actuators, and Power Systems (Priority: P1)
As a student, I want to learn about "Materials, Actuators and Power Systems" so that I can select appropriate components for building humanoid robots.
**Why this priority**: Crucial for practical robot construction.
**Independent Test**: Verify content covers material properties, types of actuators, and power supply considerations for robots.
**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** I am selecting components for a robot, **When** I consult the "Materials, Actuators and Power Systems" chapter, **Then** I can compare different motor types and their suitability for specific robotic tasks.

### Edge Cases
* What happens when complex CAD models are not available or are too large to render?
* How does the system handle missing weight/cost data for components?
