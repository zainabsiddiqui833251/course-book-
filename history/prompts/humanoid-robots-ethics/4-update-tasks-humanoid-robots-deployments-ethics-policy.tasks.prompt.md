**RESPONSE_TEXT**: 
The `/sp.tasks` command was executed, and the `tasks.md` file has been updated to include tasks for the missing chapters (US2: Real Deployments, US3: Economic Impact).

**Summary of Updated Task Details:**
*   **Feature**: Humanoid Robots: Deployments, Ethics, and Policy
*   **Branch**: `003-humanoid-robots-ethics`
*   **Task List**: `specs/003-humanoid-robots-ethics/tasks.md` has been updated.
*   **New Tasks Added**: T009, T010 (for US2 - Real Deployments); T011, T012 (for US3 - Economic Impact Analysis).
*   **Renumbered Tasks**: Original T009, T010 are now T013, T014 (Polish phase).
*   **Dependencies**: Updated to reflect the new tasks and parallelization.
*   **Parallel Opportunities**: Updated to include new parallel tasks (T009/T011, T010/T012).
*   **MVP Scope**: Remains User Story 1 and foundational aspects of User Story 4.

The `tasks.md` file now provides a more complete breakdown for Module 6.

I have also created the Prompt History Record (PHR) for this task update stage.
